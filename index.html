      <h1>Introductory Reflection / Cover Letter</h1>
      <p>
        Over the course of this semester, my writing has developed in both depth and clarity. When I first entered ENG 121, my approach to writing was more instinctive than structured, and while this sometimes produced good ideas, it often left them underdeveloped or lacking in focus. Through our assignments and workshops, I have learned how to write with intention—planning my points, considering my audience, and revising thoughtfully. This portfolio is a reflection of that journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        For my revised project, I chose my persuasive essay, “Gene Editing Supporting Space Exploration.” I selected this piece because it offered the most room for meaningful expansion and improvement based on my instructor’s feedback. The original draft was strong in organization and originality, but it needed more credibility through linked sources, clearer ethical safeguards, and a more robust discussion of oversight mechanisms. In revising, I integrated direct references to authoritative sources, proposed specific international governance models, and clarified how ethical considerations could be maintained through informed consent and global cooperation. These additions strengthened my argument while showing that I had listened carefully to feedback and acted on it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In arranging my portfolio, I placed my revised persuasive project first after the reflection because it demonstrates the most significant growth between the draft and final version. Following that, I included my unedited photo narrative and my informative essay. I chose this order to show the range of genres we worked on this semester—from visual storytelling to research-based exposition—and to highlight how different forms of writing challenge me in unique ways. The persuasive piece displays my analytical and argumentative skills, the photo narrative showcases creative storytelling and descriptive writing, and the informative essay reflects my ability to synthesize and present researched information clearly.
      </p>
      <p>
        My growth is not only in the mechanics of writing but also in my mindset. Early in the semester, I viewed revision mostly as proofreading for grammar or rephrasing awkward sentences. Now, I understand that revision is about rethinking my ideas, restructuring paragraphs, and even questioning whether my evidence is the strongest it can be. This shift in perspective has allowed me to write with greater confidence and purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a writer, I find that my voice is clear, direct, and often reflective. I like to guide the reader through my thought process rather than simply presenting conclusions. I do well at integrating examples and analogies to make complex ideas more relatable, as I did when connecting gene editing in space to fictional examples like <em>Red Rising</em> and <em>Fullmetal Alchemist</em>. I also enjoy balancing fact and narrative—grounding my work in credible research while keeping it engaging.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking ahead, I want to continue developing my ability to write with both precision and impact. This means practicing concision without losing clarity and learning how to anticipate counterarguments more effectively. I also hope to apply the strategies I’ve learned in ENG 121 to other academic and professional contexts, where clear communication and thoughtful argumentation are essential.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, this portfolio represents my progress as a writer this semester. It shows not only the quality of my work but also the process behind it—the willingness to revise deeply, the effort to address feedback thoroughly, and the ability to adapt my writing to different purposes and audiences. That growth, more than any single paper, is what I am most proud of.

    <div id="persuasive" class="section">
      <h1>Revised Persuasive Project: Gene Editing Supporting Space Exploration</h1>
      <p>
        This revised version of my persuasive project addresses the key points in my instructor’s feedback. I strengthened credibility by adding direct references to authoritative sources, linked within the text where possible. I expanded the ethical section to propose an International Gene Editing Oversight Board modeled after existing global agencies, ensuring accountability, informed consent, and transparency. I also added more context to explain why these safeguards are necessary for space exploration and linked each to real-world research. The visual presentation of this project is organized into twelve infographic slides, which you can navigate using the arrows or thumbnail images below.

      <h1>Evidence of Revision</h1>
      <p>
        The changes to my persuasive project were extensive and strategic. For example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Added hyperlinks to credible scientific sources for improved ethos.</li>
        <li>Expanded ethical safeguards with a concrete proposal for an international oversight body.</li>
        <li>Improved transitions between sections to enhance flow.</li>
        <li>Clarified technical explanations with plain language for accessibility.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Before-and-after excerpts show the transformation:</p>
      <p><strong>Before:</strong> “Gene editing can help astronauts resist radiation.”</p>
      <p><strong>After:</strong> “Gene editing—backed by research on radiation-resistant proteins such as Dsup—offers a promising path to protect astronauts, but it must be implemented under strict international review to ensure safety and informed consent.”</p>

    <!-- ================= Photo Narrative ================= -->
    <div id="photo-narrative" class="section">
      <h1>Photo Narrative – Lost in Beijing</h1>
      <p>
        My photo narrative, “Lost in Beijing,” captures the disorienting yet memorable experience of navigating an unfamiliar city. Using a series of ten photographs, I take the reader from my departure point through the winding streets, bustling markets, and unexpected detours that defined the day. Each image pairs with descriptive captions to immerse the viewer in the sensory details of the journey. This piece remains unedited from its original submission to preserve its authentic voice and pacing.

      <h1>Informative Essay – Layers of Living Knowledge at the Chicago Botanic Garden</h1>
      <p>
        Visiting the Chicago Botanic Garden on a rainy summer day turned an ordinary outing into a multisensory experience. The smell of damp earth, the mist curling around stone lanterns in the Japanese Garden, and the rhythmic crunch of gravel beneath our feet turned the assignment into something more personal. Located at 1000 Lake Cook Road in Glencoe, Illinois, the Chicago Botanic Garden spans 385 acres and holds 27 gardens and four natural areas (<em>Chicago Botanic Garden</em>). While not part of my college campus, this location carries significant meaning for many in the region. It serves as a hub of learning, healing, reflection, and community engagement.
      </p>
      <p>
        The garden’s layout resembles a plant-themed park—compartmentalized yet flowing naturally between zones. We arrived with household plus tickets, boarding a tram that looped slowly through the garden despite the drizzle. The guide pointed out highlights like the state tree (white oak) and areas modeled after Illinois’ natural history. Everything from plant selection to terrain mimicked regional ecosystems, connecting design to ecology.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Japanese Garden (Sansho-En), built on three islands, left the strongest impression. Though the exact date of its public opening varies across sources, the design began in 1975 and the dedication was held in 1982 (<em>Chicago Botanic Garden</em>). Gravel paths meander through pines and sculpted shrubs. Wooden benches and ceramic stools offer places to pause. The rain enhanced the atmosphere, dotting leaves with glistening droplets and intensifying earthy scents. A quiet man in formal clothes walked ahead of us, studying the plants in silence. It felt like sacred ground, a space where nature and mindfulness intertwine.
      </p>
      <p>
        A conservatory nearby contrasted the cool tranquility of Sansho-En with heat-loving flora: towering succulents, red rock displays, and cactus beds filled the room. Each species was labeled with habitat facts, reinforcing the garden’s educational value. Visitors could observe microclimates and adaptations, learning through immersion rather than textbooks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Indoors, we rested in a cafe surrounded by diverse visitors. Families conversed in Spanish over sandwiches; college students visited the butterfly exhibition. A janitor in an oversized uniform smiled at us despite looking exhausted—a subtle reminder of the often-invisible labor behind beautiful spaces. The atmosphere reflected community diversity, economic effort, and the labor that supports it all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Accessibility was clearly prioritized. Wide paths, gazebos, and shaded rest areas made navigation smooth. One man even lay on the grass, staring peacefully into the sky. Bikers passed calmly. Everyone seemed to coexist effortlessly, whether silent or engaged. These shared interactions among strangers and with the environment represent the social role green spaces can play in promoting public well-being.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Chicago Botanic Garden officially opened in 1972, established by the Chicago Horticultural Society, which dates back to 1890. The area was once marshland, transformed over decades with community involvement and design expertise (<em>Chicago Botanic Garden</em>). Landscape architect John O. Simonds envisioned the space as a series of island gardens—a concept still visible today. His design merged utility, accessibility, and beauty, laying the groundwork for its long-term impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time, the garden evolved into a research and education center. The Daniel F. and Ada L. Rice Plant Conservation Science Center, a partnership with Northwestern University, conducts studies on ecosystem preservation, seed banking, and climate resilience (Crane). Its mission supports long-term biodiversity planning in a changing climate. The Garden’s Plant Evaluation Program, ongoing since 1991, rigorously assesses plant performance in the Midwest’s harsh climate. This long-term research helps both scientists and home gardeners make sustainable planting decisions (<em>Chicago Botanic Garden</em>, “Plant Evaluation Notes”). Katherine A. Johnson, writing about the Garden’s Science Career Continuum, highlights its success in supporting diverse youth in STEM through immersive, real-world learning experiences. The program helps build confidence and scientific literacy in underrepresented students (Johnson 74).
      </p>
      <p>
        The Garden thrives as a space where people from all backgrounds come to recharge. On our visit, I saw solo wanderers, couples, older adults, and children—some on school trips. One young Indian boy gasped in wonder at a butterfly landing near him. This kind of early exposure to biodiversity can foster lifelong curiosity. Signs throughout the garden explain plant origins, ecological roles, and adaptation strategies. It is a living classroom as much as a refuge. For many visitors, the Garden offers emotional healing. I saw a student sketching in silence, a couple walking hand in hand, and a man lying quietly on the grass. During the pandemic, this space likely served as a rare mental sanctuary.

        Crane emphasizes that botanic gardens today are more than ornamental—they are institutions for public education, research, and civic engagement. He writes, “Botanic gardens must go beyond preserving beauty to becoming hubs of social relevance and research” (Crane). The Chicago Botanic Garden embodies this shift. It welcomes visitors not just to look, but to learn and belong. It merges scientific advancement with social equity, inviting people to explore, discover, and reflect.

        Despite its beauty, the Garden is not without issues. Some beds were overgrown or unlabeled. A few areas looked abandoned or under construction without signage. Drinking fountains were limited and aged. Garbage bins were sparse. Staff visibility was another concern. The tram staff debated aloud whether operations would continue due to the rain, creating uncertainty. Although friendly, they seemed disorganized. These minor issues, though easily addressed, stand out in a space where precision and planning are typically prioritized.

        Costs may also pose a barrier. General admission is free, but parking and some events are not. This may limit access for lower-income families. Furthermore, despite its global reach—evident in gardens styled after Japanese, English, and desert themes—the Garden lacks visible acknowledgement of Native American land history. This omission is notable given the land’s history. An exhibit or permanent installation acknowledging the area’s indigenous heritage would add ethical and educational value.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is room for improvement—better signage, infrastructure updates, and deeper inclusion of Indigenous narratives. Yet the Garden already stands as an inspiring model of how we can create spaces where both people and plants flourish. The Chicago Botanic Garden is a space where nature, community, and learning intersect. Its design invites visitors to pause and engage, its science centers drive meaningful conservation work, and its diversity of visitors reflects its broad social impact.
